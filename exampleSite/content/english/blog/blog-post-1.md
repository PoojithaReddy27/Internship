Whether you admit it or not, the rise of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence is acting as a boon in the 21st century. Humans nowadays are defeated by artificial intelligence. If you look around, you will find many related examples to this. In the adoption of machine learning, organizations need to maintain their human understanding and capacity to oversee and manage the trending technologies. Machine learning is not a panacea for cybersecurity but it allows the introduction of intelligence to the first level of defense against cyber threats for an organization. Various subjects of cybersecurity have been made more powerful with machine learning. These may include spam filters, IDS/IPS systems, false alarm rate reduction, fraud detection, cybersecurity rating, incident forecasting, and secure user authentication systems.

The best badass hackers and security professionals utilize machine learning to break and secure systems. Through this blog, let us discuss the fundamental concepts of using machine learning in cybersecurity and real-time examples of its utilization.


#### Machine learning in the domain of cybersecurity
Machine learning in the cybersecurity domain is recognizing cyber-attacks to support humans in order to manage and protect their systems effectively. There was a time when software has been developed to manage various functions like mathematical calculations that are tough to handle for human beings. And then the demand for humans increased more. After this, the next step was to elongate the capability of software by implementing artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. With the advancement of technology, the amount of data to be produced was getting bigger and bigger every minute, every hour, and every day. This led to the rise of “big data” and due to this systems became more intelligent for processing and getting a smarter sense of data. Now, as per the development of technology, many algorithms were developed (and still developing). These algorithms are now used for research areas, image processing, speech recognition, biomedical area, and in the domain of cybersecurity as well.

#### Big data and Machine learning for cybersecurity
Machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence that furnishes computers with the ability to learn without being unequivocally customized. Machine learning centers on the advancement of computer programs that can change when presented with new data. Data created from computers or sensors are prepared and have gotten some significance from this data since the utilization of the first computers. So, why is machine learning popular in recent years? Since we have as much data as any other time and we have to comprehend this data. In this manner, it is called BIG DATA.

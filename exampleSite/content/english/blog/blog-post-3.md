#### About Java : 
Java was developed in June 1991 initiated by James Gosling by Sun Microsystems. Sun Microsystems utilized Java for the first time as its core component and was first implemented in 1995. Java follows the rule of write once run anywhere (WORA) which provides no-cost run-times on popular platforms.

#### Java is:
Object-Oriented: In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended as a result of the Object model.
Platform independent: Unlike languages such as C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform-specific machine code, but rather into platform-independent byte code. This byte code can be distributed to any system over the web and is then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run. 
Simple: Java is designed to be easy to learn. 
Secure: With Java’s secure feature it allows for the development of virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.
Architectural-neutral: The Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of a Java runtime system. 
Portable: Being architectural-neutral and having no implementation-dependent aspects makes Java portable. The Java compiler is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary which is a POSIX subset.
Robust: Java makes an effort to eliminate error-prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile-time error checking and runtime checking.

#### PHP (recursive acronym for PHP – Hypertext Preprocessor) 
PHP is another general-purpose scripting programming language that is used for web development. PHP is also called the “Personal Home Page” language. PHP was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 who was a Canadian programmer. PHP is used to develop dynamic and interactive webpages. It is basically a server-side scripting language that is embedded with HTML and is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, and building e-commerce websites.


#### Python Programming : 
Python is known as an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was developed by Guido van Rossum and was first released in 1991. The best thing to being considered in the Python programming language is the ease to read and write because Python has an English-like structure. Python can be treated in a procedural manner, an object-oriented manner, or a functional manner. The syntax of Python allows Pythonists to write programs with fewer lines of code as compared to large code writings in other programming languages. Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions, and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

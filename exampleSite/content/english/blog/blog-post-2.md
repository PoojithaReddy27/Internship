### what is java programming?
Java is a most popular and widely used programming language that is defined as a collection of objects. With the use of Java, we can develop software, games, desktop applications, web applications, etc.


####  Why is Java called an Object-Oriented language?
Java is a purely object-oriented programming language because it is impossible to write any Java program without a class or object. Java is not a pure programming language focused on objects. Java supports non-primitive types of data, such as int, float, boolean, double, long, etc.

#### It is said that Java is a ‘write once and run anywhere’ language. Why it is called so?
Windows helps you to write Java code and compile it on the Windows platform. As it is in the Unix environment, the class and jar files that you get from the Windows platform will run. So it's a completely autonomous language of the platform. The Java byte code is behind all this portability. Java compiler-generated bytecode can be interpreted by any JVM. So writing programs in Java and expecting them to run on any platform is much simpler. The Javac Java compiler compiles Java code, and the Java JVM compiler runs that code.

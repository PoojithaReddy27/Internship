#### Artificial Intelligence applications: 
#### Intelligent Gaming 
AI and Machine Learning are used in intelligent gaming techniques, particularly in games that essentially require the utilization of mental skills like chess. Google DeepMind's AlphaGo figured out how to play chess, and defeat champions like Lee Sedol (in 2016) by contemplating the moves of experts as well as by figuring out how to play the game by rehearsing against itself countless times. 

#### Automated Transportation in AI
When we fly in a plane, we experience automated transportation as a human pilot is just flying the plane for two or three minutes during take-off and landing. The remainder of the flight is moved by a Flight Management System, a synchronization of GPS, motion sensors, and computer systems that track flight position. Google Maps has just changed local transport by examining coordinates from smartphones to decide how quick or moderate a vehicle is moving and along these how much traffic there is on a given street anytime. 

#### Jobs Risky in Artificial Intelligence 
Artificial intelligence technology-fueled robots are taking over perilous employments like bomb disposal and welding. In bomb disposal, today, robots should be constrained by people. Yet, scientists accept that soon there will be a time when these tasks would be handled by robots themselves. This technology has just spared many lives. In the field of welding, a dangerous activity that involves working in elevated levels of noise and heat in a poisonous environment, robots are helping weld with more prominent precision.

#### Ecological Protection 
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence run on bid data, huge stores of information, and astounding insights produced by computer systems. When put to use in the field of environmental protection, these technologies could be used to extract significant solutions for indefensible problems like ecological corruption. For example, "IBM's Green Horizon Project contemplates and analyzes ecological data from a large number of sensors and sources to create precise, advancing climate and pollution figures."

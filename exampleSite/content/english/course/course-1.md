### MACHINE LEARNING PROJECTS (4 PROJECTS)
1.Medical Treatment - Currently, the interpretation of genetic mutations is being made manually. This is a very time-consuming task where a clinical pathologist must manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature. We will build a machine learning model to organize genetic variation on Kaggle personalized medicine dataset.

2.Taxi Demand Prediction in New York City - We will predict the demand for taxi services in new york city. To find several pickups, given location coordinates(latitude and longitude) and time, in the query region and surrounding regions.

3.Quora Problem - On Quora, anyone can ask any question, and there are also chances that when you go to ask your question, someone might have already answered. We will classify the duplicate question pairs on the quora platform using machine learning techniques.

4.Stack Overflow Project - The problem says that we will be provided a bunch of questions. A question in Stack Overflow contains three segments Title, Description, and Tags. Using the text in the title and description, we should suggest the tags related to the subject of the question automatically.
